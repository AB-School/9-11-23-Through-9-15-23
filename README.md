# 9-11-23-Through-9-15-23

The date today is 9/12/23 today my teacher wanted us to either
create a page on github or google sites, you can obviously
tell which one I picked based on what I am typing here. 

He showed us professinal examples of the About Me page and
showed what he did and what it changed.

There were several videos that went over OOP or Object Oreintated Programming.
There were 4 of them: 
Abstraction: Calling the method we use.
Inherentence: Transfering the data between classes.
Polymorphism: Changes the variable data to another class.
Encapsulation: Sets the variables for a certian class and not all of them.

There is a thing called logo used as a computer programming language to draw.
The cursor on the programming language is called turtle.
The turtle will follow directions typed in the terminal or input section.

It also taught some basic commands:
?Forward (Amount),
?Left (Amount),
?Right (Amount),
?SetPC (Color Number),
?SetBG (Color Number)

They also made a small "tortise" robot used for drawing in the real world and not on the computer only.

---------------------------
##New Python

In order to import turtle into python do this command line: "from turtle import *" or "import turtle"

Creating a turtle is like this:
[Name of Turtle you want] = turtle.Turtle()

The new commands are this:

[Name of Turtle].forward(Amount),
[Name of Turtle].left(Amount),
[Name of Turtle].right(Amount),
[Name of Turtle].beginfill(),
[Name of Turtle].endfill(),
[Name of Turtle].color("Name of Color")
